-- Linked List -- 
Linked List is a linear structure where each element is a separate entity. Each element (called a node) is comprised of 2 items, the data and a reference to the next node. If the list is empty the reference to the next node will be null. Linked List are a dynamic data structure. When we have a structure of multiple nodes, that creates a linked list.
