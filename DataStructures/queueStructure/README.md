A Queue Structure is a structure that deals with an ordered list of records. 
The container of the records is called a Queue. The Queue Structure uses FIFO 
(First In First Out), and uses the methods 'add' to add a record to the queue, 
'remove' to remove the oldest record from the queue, and 'peek' to see the last 
record without removing it.
