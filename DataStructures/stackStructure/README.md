A Stack Structure is similar to a Queue, we are still dealing with an ordered list of records. 
Records live inside a container, and that container is the Stack. To insert a record, we use 'push' 
and to remove a record we use 'pop'. The difference between a Stack and a Queue is the order in which 
records are added and removed. With Queues, they use FIFO (First In First Out), meanwhile Stacks are 
FILO (First In Last Out). The implementation is similar to a Queue.
