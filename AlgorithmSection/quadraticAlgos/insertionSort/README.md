------------ Selection Sort Pseudocode ------------
1) Start by picking the second element in the array
2) Compare the second elmemnt with the previous one and swap if necessary
3) Continue to the next element and if it's in the incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion to place the element in the correct place
4) Continue until the array is sorted
