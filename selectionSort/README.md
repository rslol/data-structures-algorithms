Similar to bubble sort, but by placing small values into sorted positions

------------ Selection Sort Pseudocode ------------
1 - Store the first element as the smallest value in the array
2 - Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number 
3 - If smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new 'minimum' (index[0]) and continue till end of the array
4 - If 'minimum' is not the value you initially began with, swap the two values
5 - Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted
